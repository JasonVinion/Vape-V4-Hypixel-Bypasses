## Reporting a Vulnerability

Given that this is a tutorial project, there's no actual code that might have vulnerabilities in the traditional sense. However, we understand that outdated information, especially in tutorials, can mislead learners and potentially result in insecure practices.

If you find any information to be out of date or inaccurate, please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file on how to suggest corrections or updates.

### Process

1. **Do not open an issue for security-related concerns.** It's crucial to keep vulnerability reports private to prevent potential misuse.
2. Instead, please send an email detailing your findings to [vinionjason@gmail.com](mailto:vinionjason@gmail.com).
3. Next please warn users on https://forums.vape.gg and report it to official staff there.
5. Once the issue is resolved, or if it's deemed that there's no actionable concern, we'll provide feedback to you.

Your patience and discretion in these matters are greatly appreciated. We value the security and integrity of our project, and your collaboration in ensuring its safety is highly valuable.

Thank you for being an integral part of our community and for your vigilance in keeping it safe!
